    <h3> Conquiring the stigma behind body dysmorphia among college women </h3>
      <p> According to the Mayo Clinic, <a href = "https://www.mayoclinic.org/
        diseases-conditions/body-dysmorphic-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-
        20353938"> body dysmorphic disorder </a> is "a mental disorder
          in which you can't stop thinking about one or more perceived defects or flaws
          in your appearance — a flaw that, to others, is either minor or not
          observable." In today’s society, young women not only struggle with the
          pressure to appear flawless but also with the idea that they could possibly
          suffer from a mental disorder. On the contrary, many women do not comprehend
          the concept of body-dysmorphia, and the anxiety and compulsive tendencies
          that might ensue as a result. Despite the availability of medications and
          psychotherapy, it is uncommon for sufferers, particularly young women, to
          seek guidance as understanding or willingness to admit a problem becomes a
          challenge. </p>

      <p> A contributing factor is based upon how bodies, in particular the presence of
          perceived flaws or the lack of,  are depicted across different social media
          platforms. Dr. Jasmine Fardouly Macquarie University’s Centre for Emotional
          Health has reaching social influences on body image, more specifically social
          media. She finds that <a href = "https://nedc.com.au/research-and-
          resources/show/issue-46-social-media-and-body-image">
          "people tend to curate their social media feeds in order
          to present the best version of themselves on social media
          (Zhao, Grasmuck, & Martin, 2008), some tend to post only the most attractive
          images on these sites” (Fardouly). </a> </p>
        <p> Additionally, affiliating with a sorority or
          being on a sports team while in college, has also adversely impacted people's
          attitude towards their bodies. Despite these negative trends, some individuals
          started deleting their social media accounts to focus more on themselves,
          rather than someone else. However, Dr. Fardouly <a href
          = "https://nedc.com.au/research-and-
          resources/show/issue-46-social-media-and-body-image">
          also found that </a> “there
          is a link between spending more time on social media platforms or
          engaging with more appearance-related content (e.g., images) on social media
          and greater body image concerns and disordered eating among
          young men and
          women” (Fardouly). </p>

      <p>  The University of Maryland is not unlike other college campuses.
          Surveys were collected from female women in sororities and student athletes
          at the University of Maryland, College Park. Although this survey can gain
          recognition from campuses elsewhere, focusing on one particular area could
          be the stimulus needed to effectuate a changing dynamic around body
          dysmorphia. Questions were provided in the survey intending for females to
          think more in-depth and consider promoting more of a positive light around
          this disorder. Each survey had similar questions; however, would question
          the sorority’s atmosphere around body imaging. </p>

        <blockquote>
          Audrey Decker, a member of the Delta Delta Delta chapter at UMD,
          has lived in her sorority house for three semesters.
          “I was familiar to body dysmorphia prior to joining a
          sorority, however it has become more apparent since living in my sorority
          house,” states Decker.</blockquote>
        <p> The study also included short answer responses
          aiming to receive the most honest and thorough answers. The goal was to
          focus directly on the female’s self and goals, while also gaining
          perspective on the greater picture, whether in a sorority or on an
          athletic team. </p>
      <p>   Eight different sororities on campus were surveyed. Out of the 65 responses,
         only nine women are comfortable with their current weight and have never
         been upset with their body shape. The 56 others aspire to lose weight to
         feel more comfortable in their skin and have been emotionally affected
         by their body shape. Although losing weight can be healthy, several
         cases were showing a drastic weight cut, which could be detrimental.
        </p>

      <p>Social media has become a part of people’s everyday lives, a platform
          used by all. Those who responded to the survey all responded yes to
          using Instagram. However, 2% of women in sororities do not use Snapchat,
          while 3% of them do not use Facebook, both popular applications. </p>

      <p>  Within the sorority questionnaire, a majority of the women admitted
          to judging people on social media. Answers of what the judgement
          included were “the way they look and what experiences they are
          having”, “appearance, style, wealth”, “if they are pretty and skinny”,
          and “how skinny their stomach is.” </p>

      <p>   All the female athletes that responded admitted to judging others on social
          media. Their reasoning is as follows, “clothes, hair, makeup, body”, “type of
          posts and looks”, and “appearance and how they show themselves.” </p>

      <p>  Very similar to the viewpoints of those in a sorority, each of them focuses
          on appearance. A majority of the women acknowledged that they use social
          media to gain inspiration about how to look. </p>

          <blockquote> From a positive standpoint, a
          woman in Kappa Alpha Theta said that social media is more of a reminder
          rather than a tool to attain inspiration, while a member of the Alpha Phi
          chapter relies on Instagram to influence her outfit choices.
        </blockquote>
      <p>  Although both members of a sorority and athletes on a sports team lead
          different lives, it is clear the effect social media has on body imaging.
          Unfortunately, using social media as a means of motivation leads to
          emotional distress. The chart below shows the responses to how girls,
          both in a sorority and on an athletic team, emotionally feel towards the
          images they view on Instagram, Snapchat, and Facebook. Jealous,
          depressed/sad, angry, other and all of the above were the options provided.
          Most women in a sorority and on a sports team felt jealous based off of the
          content they saw on social media. </p>

            <div class = "col-md-6">

            </div>
          </div>

      <p> Although this has become a new trend, of both surveys, more than 1/2
        of the girls deleted their social media page to help better their
        mental health.
        </p>

      <p>  Weight is a controversial topic as women today are spectacle about answering
          confidently if it were to come up in conversation. Both surveys asked women
          to put their actual weight and their ideal weight. Many women’s current
          weight was greater than their ideal weight. However, several believed
          that their ideal weight was their current weight. </p>

            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

      <p>  However, working out has been a factor to how women portray their image.
          In a sorority, over 35% of women stated that they work out between 2-4 hours
          a week, while only 7% of women work out every day. </p>
        <div class="photo9">
          <img src ="% of sorority girls that work out.png"
          alt="Working Out-Sorority">
        </div>
          <p>  Women today have varied opinions about how they can help conquer body
              imaging. Those in sororities and on sports teams were
              positive, in that they all felt they could provide insight and help to
              those that may be struggling. </p>
