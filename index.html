    <h3> Conquiring the stigma behind body dysmorphia among college women </h3>
      <p> In today’s technological society, young women not only struggle with
        the pressure to appear flawless but also with the idea that this social
        burden can lead to a mental disorder. Navigating these evolving feelings
         of self-expression, the University of Maryland is not unlike other
         college campuses. Surveys were collected from women affiliated with
         sororities and female student athletes at the University of Maryland,
         College Park. Questions were provided in the survey, intending to elicit
          a more in-depth thought analysis in regard to body images.
        Therefore promoting more of a positive light around body dysmorphia.
      </p>

    <blockquote>
      <div class = "quote"> “One of most important influences on body
        dissatisfaction and appearance focus in adolescent girls is how
        appearance focused their peers are.”  </div>
      <div class= "speaker"> - Heather R. Gallivan of Park Niccollet Melrose Center.  </div>
          </blockquote>

          <p> Although this survey can gain recognition and similarities from
          campuses elsewhere, focusing on one particular campus could be the
          stimulus needed to effectuate a changing dynamic relating to body dysmorphia.

      <p> Body dysmorphia <a href = "https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/body-dysmorphic-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20353938" target="_blank">
      a mental disorder that dramatically skews one's perception of him or herself,
     </a> is particularly common among young women — though it is not widely
     understood. The disorder can lead to anxiety or other compulsions, and many
      are unwilling to seek guidance or even admit a problem. </p>

      <p> Each sample group had similar questions. The anonymous study also
        included short answer responses aiming to receive the most honest and
        thorough feedback. The goal was to focus directly on the female’s
        self-image and goals, while also gaining perspective on the greater
        picture, whether in a sorority or on an athletic team. </p>
        <blockquote>
                <div class = "quote">  “Before I joined a sorority, I was familiar
                  with body dysmorphia, but after living in my sorority house I have
                  realized how many girls struggle with the image they see in the
                  mirror. It’s honestly really sad.”  </div>
                <div class= "speaker"> - Audrey Decker, a member of the Delta Delta Delta chapter at UMD.   </div>
                    </blockquote>
      <p> Eight different sororities on campus were surveyed. Out of the 65
        responses, only nine women are comfortable with their current weight
        and have never been upset with their body shape. The 56 others aspire
        to lose weight, feel more comfortable with their bodies and have been
        emotionally affected by their perceived body shape. Although losing
        weight can be healthy, several cases exhibited a drastic weight loss,
        which could be detrimental both physically and emotionally. </p>
      <p> Weight is a controversial topic as women today are hesitant about
        answering truthfully if it were to come up in conversation. Both
        surveys asked women to put their actual weight and their ideal weight.
        Many women’s current weight was greater than what they envisioned as
        their ideal weight. However, several believed that their ideal weight
         was in fact their current weight. </p>
      <p> In addition to diet, exercise is part of the whole process to
        attaining self-goals. Exercise regimens have been a factor
        contributing to confidence and how women portray their image.
        In a sorority, over 35% of women stated that they work out between
        2-4 hours a week, while 7% of women work out every day. </p>

        <div class ="insight">
      <p> Social media has become a part of people’s everyday lives, a
        platform used by all. Those who responded to the survey all
        responded yes to using Instagram. However, 2% of women in sororities
        do not use Snapchat, while 3% of them do not use Facebook, both
        popular applications. </p>

      <p>A contributing factor to body imaging is based upon how bodies,
        in particular the presence of perceived flaws or the lack of, are
        depicted across different social media platforms. </p> <p> Dr. Jasmine
        Fardouly Macquarie University’s Centre for Emotional Health has
        recognized trends and concerns on social media. She finds that
        <a href = "https://nedc.com.au/research-and-resources/show/issue-46-social-media-and-body-image" target = "_blank">
        "people tend to curate their social media feeds </a> in order
        to present the best version of themselves on social media
        (Zhao, Grasmuck, & Martin, 2008), some tend to post only the most attractive
        images on these sites” (Fardouly). </p>
    <p> Although both members of a sorority and athletes on a sports team
      lead different lives, it is clear the effect social media has on body
      imaging. Unfortunately, using technological platforms as a means of
      motivation ultimately leads to social pressures and emotional distress.
      The chart below shows the responses to how girls, both in a sorority
      and on an athletic team, emotionally feel towards the images they view
      on Instagram, Snapchat, and Facebook. Jealous, depressed/sad, angry,
      other feelings and all of the above were the options provided. Most
      women in a sorority and on a sports team felt jealousy based off of
      the content they saw on social media. </p>

    <p> Based on the comments, affiliating with a sorority or being on a
      sports team while in college, has adversely impacted people's attitude
      towards their bodies. Despite these negative trends, some individuals
      have begun deleting their social media accounts in order to focus more
      on themselves, rather than someone else. Additionally, Dr. Fardouly <a href = "https://nedc.com.au/research-and-resources/show/issue-46-social-media-and-body-image" target = "blank">
      also found that </a> “there is a link between spending more time on social media platforms or
      engaging with more appearance-related content (e.g., images) on social media
      and greater body image concerns and disordered eating among
      young men and women” (Fardouly).  </p>
      <div class = "photo5">

      </div>
        <p> Within the sorority questionnaire, a majority of the women
          admitted to judging people on social media. Answers of what the
          judgement included were “the way they look and what experiences
          they are having”, “appearance, style, wealth”, “if they are pretty
          and skinny”, and “how skinny their stomach is.” </p>

      <p> Interestingly, all the female athletes that responded admitted to
        judging others on social media. Their reasoning is as follows,
        “clothes, hair, makeup, body”, “type of posts and looks”, and
        “appearance and how they show themselves.” </p>
      <p> Very similar to the viewpoints of those in a sorority, each of them
        focuses on appearance. A majority of the women acknowledged that they
        use social media to gain inspiration about how to look. </p>
      <blockquote> <div class = "line"> A woman in Kappa Alpha Theta said that
      social media is more of a reminder rather than a tool to attain inspiration,
      while a member of the Alpha Phi chapter relies on Instagram to influence
      her outfit choices. </div>
      </blockquote>

      <p> However, women today have varied opinions about how they can help
        conquer body imaging. Those in sororities and on sports teams were
        positive, in that they all felt they could provide insight and help
        to those that may be struggling. </p>

                  is no reason to feed into making other people self-conscious
                  or concerned with how they look. </li>
